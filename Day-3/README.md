### Summary
Day 3 focused on **backtracking problems**:
- Palindrome Partitioning â†’ String recursion + palindromes  
- Sudoku Solver â†’ Constraint satisfaction, deep backtracking  
- Word Search â†’ Backtracking on 2D grid  

These problems complete the **core backtracking template set**, preparing us for dynamic programming in the upcoming days.
