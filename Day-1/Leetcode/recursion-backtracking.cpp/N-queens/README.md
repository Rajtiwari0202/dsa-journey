# Leetcode 51. N-Queens

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` chess queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

---

## üîç Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 9`

---

## üí° Approach (Backtracking)

We place queens row by row, making sure:
- No two queens share the same column
- No two queens share the same diagonal

For each row, try placing a queen in each column and:
- If it‚Äôs valid (safe), move to next row recursively
- Backtrack by removing the queen if it leads to a dead-end

Used 3 hash sets to keep track of:
- Columns used
- Main diagonals
- Anti-diagonals

---

## üß† Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N!)` ‚Äî Because we try N options for each queen and prune invalid cases.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N^2)` ‚Äî For storing the board and recursion stack.

## ‚úÖ Sample Input & Output

Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."], ["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
