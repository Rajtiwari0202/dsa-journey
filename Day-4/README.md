# ðŸš€ Day 4 - Dynamic Programming Practice

In Day 4, I focused on some **classic DP problems** that strengthened my ability to apply recursion, memoization, tabulation, and optimized approaches.

## ðŸ“Œ Problems Covered

### 1. Climbing Stairs
- **Recursion:** Try all possibilities (exponential time).  
- **Memoization:** Top-down caching of results.  
- **Tabulation:** Bottom-up DP filling an array.  
- **Space Optimized:** Use two variables instead of an array.

---

### 2. House Robber
- **Recursion:** Choose to rob or skip a house.  
- **Memoization:** Store results of overlapping subproblems.  
- **Tabulation:** Iterative DP array for max profit.  
- **Space Optimized:** Use two variables to track choices.

### 3. Maximum Subarray (Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm)
- **Brute Force:** Check all subarrays (O(nÂ²)).  
- **Kadaneâ€™s Optimal:** Linear time O(n), keep running maximum.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings
- Learned the **DP transition flow** (Recursion â†’ Memoization â†’ Tabulation â†’ Optimization).  
- Understood how to **transform recursive relations into iterative DP**.  
- Implemented **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm**, one of the most famous DP optimizations.
