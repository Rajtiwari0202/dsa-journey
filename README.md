# 🧠 JP Morgan Internship Prep – DSA in C++

This repository contains my **structured daily preparation** for cracking high-paying internships, specifically targeting **JP Morgan**, using C++.  
I am following a combination of:
- ✅ Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet
- ✅ LeetCode Problems
- ✅ C++ STL Mastery
- ✅ Daily GitHub commits
- ✅ Real-time notes and clean code
